**Asynchronous [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) subagents and agent fleet orchestration for parallel coding agents with nested delegation, background work, and supervision in [herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr).**

Keep the conversation. Delegate the work.

Pi Herdsman is a Pi extension for asynchronous subagents and multi-agent
coding. Delegate coding tasks to managed background agents running in
independent Pi sessions while the lead conversation stays interactive. Run
coding agents in parallel, nest delegation, steer active agents, route
questions and results back to their owning agent, and supervise multiple leads
through one coordinated hierarchy.

Use it in an existing Pi/herdr setup or deploy the SSH-ready container as a
portable remote coding-agent environment. [herdr Machines](https://herdr.dev/docs/connecting-machines/)
can bring local and remote workspaces and agents into one herdr window over
normal SSH.

Pi Herdsman calls its managed subagents **agents**.

```text
You ↔ lead
      ├─ agent
      │  └─ agent
      └─ agent
```

A lead and its nested agent hierarchy form a herd, Herdsman's model of an
agent fleet.

Pi Herdsman is opinionated about coordination, not workflow. A lead owns its
agents, and a delegation-enabled agent may own permitted agents of its own.
Agent definitions, models, tools, extensions, and development process remain up
to you.

## Install

### Existing Pi / herdr

```sh
pi install npm:pi-herdsman
herdr integration install pi
```

Start Herdr in your project:

```sh
herdr
```

Then run Pi in the Herdr pane:

```sh
pi
```

### oh-my-pi (omp) runtime

omp is a pi fork whose bundled legacy-pi host shims diverge from upstream pi
0.87. This fork (`kevinnguyenhoang91/pi-herdsman`) adds a compatibility layer
for it; see `extension/omp-compat.ts`.

Caveat: `omp plugin install github:kevinnguyenhoang91/pi-herdsman` **fails**
— omp's installer runs `bun install` with lifecycle scripts untrusted, so the
`prepare` build never produces `dist/` and extension validation aborts with
`declared extension entry not found on disk`. Install through bun directly
instead:

```sh
# once: allow the fork's build script in the omp plugins root
# (adds "trustedDependencies": ["pi-herdsman"])
cd ~/.omp/plugins
bun add --trust github:kevinnguyenhoang91/pi-herdsman
```

Then enable it in omp's plugin state (`~/.omp/plugins/omp-plugins.lock.json`):

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "pi-herdsman": { "version": "0.15.0", "enabledFeatures": null, "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

herdr launches omp with `--kind omp`; install its omp integration once:

```sh
herdr integration install omp
```

Upgrading later:

```sh
cd ~/.omp/plugins
bun remove pi-herdsman
bun add --trust github:kevinnguyenhoang91/pi-herdsman
# re-add the lockfile entry above if omp plugin list no longer shows it
```

### Docker / remote machine

For a self-contained, SSH-ready remote coding-agent environment, see
[Container deployment](docs/guides/container-deployment.md).

Once normal SSH access works, the same container can be saved as a herdr
machine:

```sh
herdr machine add ssh://herdsman@host:2222 --label my-herd
```

A host defined in normal SSH configuration can be used directly instead.

## Try it

Ask Pi normally:

```text
Use scout to inspect this repository.
```

That's enough. The agent runs asynchronously while the lead conversation remains
available.

Other useful requests look the same:

```text
Use scout to map the authentication flow.
Have researcher verify the current upstream API behavior.
Have reviewer inspect this diff for correctness and unnecessary complexity.
Run scout and researcher independently while we continue planning here.
```

Open the human agent management surface at any time with:

```text
/agents
```

To supervise independent leads across the current herdr runtime, use:

```text
/chief
```

Chief supervision is separate from ownership:

```text
chief
  ├─ herd A / lead A
  │  └─ agents...
  └─ herd B / lead B
     └─ agents...
```

Leave chief mode with:

```text
/chief leave
```

See [supervision](docs/concepts/supervision.md) and the
[supervision reference](docs/reference/supervision.md).

For the complete walkthrough, see [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md).

## Why Pi Herdsman?

- **Async subagents by default.** Assignments return after acceptance while agents keep
  running and the owning lead session remains available. Results and owner
  questions return when they need attention.
- **One assignment per agent.** Each managed agent generation handles one
  bounded assignment, delivers its terminal result, and is cleaned up. Continue
  completed context with the explicit `continue` action and exact returned Pi session.
- **Nested multi-agent orchestration.** Delegation-enabled agents can own and manage
  permitted agents themselves. Identity, ownership, steering, clarification,
  results, and cleanup share the same lifecycle across the hierarchy.
- **Your workflow stays yours.** Use the bundled portable roles, override them,
  or bring your own definitions, models, tools, extensions, and process. Pi
  Herdsman does not prescribe a plan, implementation, or review workflow.
- **Small and disciplined.** Pi Herdsman focuses on orchestration semantics.
  herdr manages physical sessions and placement; Pi keeps owning each
  conversation and turn state.

See [Lifecycle](docs/concepts/lifecycle.md) for the exact asynchronous contract.

## How it works

Pi Herdsman deliberately separates three responsibilities:

- **herdr** owns physical agent lifecycle and placement.
- **Pi Herdsman** owns assignment, clarification, result, and control
  coordination.
- **Pi** owns each session and turn state.

The model-facing tools are `agent`, `chief`, `peer`, `staff`, and `ask_owner`.
`agent` manages owned assignments, `chief` sends messages or asks to the chief,
`peer` lets ordinary leads message independent ordinary leads, `staff` lets the
chief supervise leads, and `ask_owner` lets an agent ask its exact owner. Leads
use `chief.message` and `chief.ask`; ordinary leads use `peer.list` and
`peer.message` with exact Pi session IDs; the active chief uses
`staff.message` and `staff.reply` with exact lead session IDs. Agent labels are
not continuation handles: exact Pi session IDs are the continuation selector.
A continued session reuses its saved logical label. Exact herdr identifiers are
validation evidence behind live agent and lead identity.

Bundled definitions are portable defaults, not required workflow stages. Global
definitions can override them or add new roles with your preferred models,
tools, extensions, skills, and instructions.

## Requirements

- [herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr) `>=0.9.1`
- Pi `>=0.87.0 <0.88.0` (supported)
- Node `>=22.19.0`

Package CI validates the minimum supported Node 22.19.0 runtime. The container
separately ships and validates Node 26.

Install or refresh the herdr Pi integration:

```sh
herdr integration install pi
herdr integration status
```

The package manifest loads the bundled extension and exposes the optional
`agents` skill.

## Compatible extensions

Pi Herdsman interoperates with optional Pi extensions without depending on
them:

- [pi-web-access](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-web-access) — the bundled
  `researcher` recognizes its standard web-research tools.
- [pi-permission-system](https://github.com/gotgenes/pi-packages/tree/main/packages/pi-permission-system)
  — shared agent frontmatter, active-agent identity, and subagent lineage
  conventions support per-agent permission policy.

Neither extension is required or installed by Pi Herdsman.
